# The NBA 3 Point Shot

This is a data anaysis project I made after reading alot about fans and critics complaining there are too many 3-point shots in the NBA.

I wanted to find out for myself, so I collected the data from [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com) from the 1979-80 season to the 2023-24 season to find out.

Heres a list of the files:

1. The 3 Point Shot.pdf - A PDF of the Powerpoint Presentation
2. The 3 Point Shot.pptx - Powerpoint Presentation of the data, including charts and graphs.
3. team_stats_csv.csv - A CSV of the raw data extracted from basketball-reference.com
4. team_stats_excel - An excel file with Pivot tables and charts and graphs for power point.
